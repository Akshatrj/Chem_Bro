# 🌟 ChemBro — Python-Based Electron Shell Visualizer & Element Info Tool

ChemBro is a **Python-powered educational tool** designed to help students easily understand **electron configurations** and **atomic structure**. It automatically generates **electron shell diagrams** using Turtle graphics and retrieves **detailed element information** from a structured dataset.

# ChemBro

A simple Python project that lets you explore basic atomic structure by drawing electron shells based on the atomic number. It’s meant to make the periodic table a bit more visual and easier to understand.

## 1. Project Overview
Chem_Bro is a small tool that takes an atomic number (1–118) and shows basic details of the element along with a simple shell diagram using Python’s Turtle graphics. The idea is to help students visualize how electrons are arranged around an atom.

## 2. Problem Statement
Understanding electron arrangement can be difficult when only shown static textbook diagrams. This project tries to make it easier by drawing the structure dynamically.

## 3. Objectives
- Accept atomic number input  
- Show element information  
- Calculate electron distribution  
- Draw shells and electrons  
- Keep the program simple and beginner-friendly  

## 4. Technologies Used
### Python
Chosen for its simplicity and readability.

### Turtle Graphics
Used for drawing circles and electrons visually.

### PyAutoGUI
Helps manage display issues when the Turtle window opens.

### Keyboard Library
Provides basic keyboard interaction without needing a full GUI.

## 5. Features
- Supports all 118 elements  
- Displays element details  
- Draws a simple shell model  
- Interactive and easy to run  

## 6. How to Run
1. Install Python  
2. Install required packages:
```
pip install pyautogui
pip install keyboard
```
3. Run:
```
python chemBro.py
```
4. Enter atomic number
